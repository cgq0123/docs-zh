title: API Use Cases
description: Here's ways in which our early adopters are using the API!
---

We haven't even launched publicly yet. But even the early adopters from our community have surprised us with the number of ways they have utilized the Dune API.

### Alerts for On Chain Activity, and more!

One of the most killer use cases of the API is to build an alerting system for on chain activity. Our frens at [Cow Protocol](https://dune.com/cowprotocol) have not only built a tool for this, which they are actively using. They have also open sourced it. You can checkout their code at [this link](https://github.com/cowprotocol/dune-alerts).

In the light of all the hacks that ensued in the ecosystem over the recent past; these alerting systems can be crucial for the next generation of dapps. Any malicious actiity can be stopped, right in its tracks. And this is just one of the ways alerting systems are useful.

We have to give a shoutout to our fren [@bh2smith](https://dune.com/bh2smith) from the Cow Protocol, who has been building community goods with the Dune API at a pace faster than we can keep up with. We highly recommend checking out [the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OXTE2lU6MQ) he gave at [DuneCon 2022](https://dunecon.com) on building Backend Data Infrastructure with the Dune API.

### Making the data flow to the last mile

Data has never been as open as it is on Blockchains. While Dune directly enables this data to flow through data analysts and engineers. We are being joined by our community to further us in our mission.

#### Moonblock - Web3 brand intelligence

We will directly quote the words [Moonblock](https://moonblock.io/) uses to describe what they are doing with On Chain Data - "We enable marketing managers to make faster, smarter decisions by organizing, analyzing and visualizing the worldâ€™s Web3 information."

Using the Dune API to make the data flow to non-technical power users and decision makers, not bad, right?

#### Boto - On Chain automation with No Code 

[Boto](https://boto.io/) enables you to automate the work you have to manually do to check activites on chain (aka Build bots with No Code).

Again, using the Dune API to empower a much wider range of users with Open Data.

Our beta users have been so promising that we might in fact launch a special program for Startups to build with the Dune API. Stay tuned on our [socials](https://dune.com/community) for any updates.

### Hackathon Projects

The Dune API got used by hackers at EthBerlin, EthSF and EthIndia in 2022. We had 63 submissions across these events. If you are a builder or a wizard and want to start tinkering with the API. Checkout some of the work our bounty winners from these hackathons have worked on.
