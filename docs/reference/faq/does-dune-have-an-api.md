# Does Dune have an API?

**Dune does have an API!**

To get access, you'll need to  sign up for a paid plan then add on API access. 

[See here for pricing details](https://dune.com/pricing).

[Learn more about how to use our API here](../../api/index.md)!

If you don't have API access, [paid plan users](https://dune.com/pricing) can export results as CSV and anyone can embed Dune charts on their page for free by clicking "[Embed](../../getting-started/embeds.md)" on any query Visualization.
